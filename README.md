# tile buddy

![](demo.gif)

A little web app to generate, scale, tile and download background images.

I use this to take `--tile` midjourney images and generate larger background for use in my videos.

## Using

Right now, you just drag + drop the image onto the browser, scale it up/down, and then take a screenshot.

## I'd like to

1. Store all images drag + dropped in the browser with the FS API, or Index DB
2. have the ability to download common sizes - similar to <https://overlay.wesbos.com>
3. Hook into an API for generating these? I tried Stable Diffusion, but the results were not as good.

pretty simple app - would take PRs if anyone wants to help.
